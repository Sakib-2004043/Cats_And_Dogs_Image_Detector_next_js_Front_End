# Cats and Dogs Image Detection

This project is a deep learning-based application that detects whether an image contains a cat or a dog with an accuracy of 80%. The frontend is built using Next.js, while the backend is managed with Python, utilizing a virtual environment.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend**: Developed with Next.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for uploading images.
- **Backend**: Powered by Python, the backend processes the images and performs the detection using a trained deep learning model.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images directly through the web interface.
- **Real-time Detection**: Once an image is uploaded, the backend quickly processes it to determine if the image contains a cat or a dog.
- **Accuracy**: The model achieves an 80% accuracy rate in distinguishing between cats and dogs.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React Framework)
- **Backend**: Python (within a virtual environment)
- **Deep Learning**: Trained model for image classification

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed for the frontend.
- Python and a virtual environment set up for the backend.
